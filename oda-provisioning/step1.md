On the left hand side, in the menu you will find 'Digital Assistant'.

Once you click on it, on the following screen you will need to select a Compartment.
As explained in the past scenarios, a Compartment allows you to organize and isolate your cloud resources to control the access to those resources.
For this hands-on, you can select the default compartment 'ManagedCompartmentForPaaS'.
